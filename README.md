# Surf-sup
Overview
  - The overview of the project is to provide temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order    to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
  
Results
  - The table below shows the temperature information in the month of June.

  - We can see that there are some differences between the temperature in June and December. I initially thought the differences would be larger but it didn't turn out that way. An example is the mean temperature. June registered a mean temperature of 75 while December registered 71. The temperature gap isn't that wide because Hawaii is a tropical country with two seasons compared to Toronto with 4 seasons. A city and country with four seasons would have a greater difference in mean and standard deviation between seasons.

  - An additional querry that returns the precipitation, the first table shows June and the second shows December. The precipitation for December is 60% more than June. 
  - The business is not sustainable all year around. Even though the difference in temperature in June and December aren't that great, there is a lot more rain in December than in June, which means that tourism is probably lower in December. 
  
Summary
  - The overview of the project is to provide temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order    to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Due to Hawaii being in a tropical 2 season climate, it may be tempting to assume that by looking at the temperatures we can conclude that it is same all year round. But if we look closer into the data we can see that December rains 60% more than June - these are not attractive for tourists. In conclusion, in my opinion the business is not sustainable all year around.
