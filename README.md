  - We can see that there are some differences between the temperature in June and December. I initially thought the differences would be larger but it didn't turn out that way. An example is the mean temperature. June registered a mean temperature of 75 while december registered 71. The temperature gap isn't that wide because Hawaii is a tropical country with two seasons compared to Toronto with 4 seasons. A city and country with four seasons would have a greater difference in mean and standard deviation between seasons.
